![Cover](./assets/Cover.png)

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations by building a straightforward employee management system. It highlights best practices for utilizing TanStack React Query, Axios, and other technologies to develop a functional CRUD application using Next.js with TypeScript.

## üìù Features

- **Create**: Add new employees to the system with relevant details.
- **Read**: Fetch and display employee information from the backend.
- **Update**: Modify existing employee records as needed.
- **Delete**: Remove employee records from the system.

## üíª Technologies

- [**Next JS:**](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- [**Zod:**](https://zod.dev/) A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- [**Axios:**](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server.
- [**@tanstack/react-query:**](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/framework/react/installation) A data-fetching library for managing server state in React applications.
- [**React-Hot-Toast:**](https://react-hot-toast.com/) A lightweight and customizable toast notification library for React.
